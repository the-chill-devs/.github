### Who we are

We are a collective of developers fostering a chill, supportive environment where we teach each other while building software solutions and bring to life ideas we come up with.
We believe in responsible development and aim to grow as a group by informing ourselves with proper coding/programming practices that also put us up there with the greatest in the 
SWD/SWE (Software Development/Software Engineering) map or field.

We also run a small community on Discord where we share resources for reference and self-growth in the journey to becoming a better software developer/engineer. Join our server by clicking [here](https://discord.gg/9yaEMbJM)

### Key Projects

We are currently working on a long-term project called **Eden** - a mental wellness platform which will ship to web and mobile soon. Besides this, we will be releasing a set of meaningful
projects and templates which will be listed here.
